**Hotel Booking Predication**
This project aims to develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts hotel booking cancellations based on customer and booking data. By analyzing booking behavior, customer demographics, and hotel features, the model helps hotel management reduce cancellations, optimize room allocation, and enhance customer satisfaction.
